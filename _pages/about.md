Short bio
======
I'm Dhirpal, a Computer Science PhD student at the University of Chicago advised by Fred Chong. I work at the intersection of quantum error correction, compiler architectures, and applications in biology. I am currently working on quantum-classical hybrid algorithms for biological problems like feature selection and previously helped design a compiler and gate-scheduling approach for neutral-atom systems. On the industry side, I’ve shipped features at AlphaSense, built quantum software tooling at Infleqtion (Superstaq), founded a student-creator marketplace (SponsU), and spent time evaluating early-stage companies as a venture analyst.

Research interests
======
- Quantum–biology interfaces, including pipelines that connect quantum algorithms to biological data analysis 
- Fault-tolerant quantum computing and practical error-correction workflows on real devices  
- Quantum compiler design and scheduling for neutral-atom architectures
- Developer tooling for algorithm prototyping and benchmarking in Qiskit and Cirq

Career aspirations
======
I want to build dependable quantum–classical toolchains for biotech—bridging algorithms, compilers, and error mitigation to support tasks like robust feature discovery and predictive modeling. My goal is to translate research prototypes into usable workflows for scientists and clinicians while staying grounded in solid systems work.

Miscellaneous
======
- Avid reader; see @sibling_reads on instagram
- I love playing football (soccer). Was part of the National Championship winning team at UChicago in 2022.
- I speak English, Mandarin, Hindi, Gujarati
